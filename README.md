### Coding Principle and Convention

- Group related files by directory, it's easy to focusing on small portions and
  avoid complexity
    + Organize files by feature not by function.
    + Store the test files next to the code.
- Be pragmatic modules: the node philosophy about **small modules** and **single
  purpose modules**
    + Only build modules as needed follow YANGI principle
- Place Your Test Files Next to The Implementation
- Put your long npm scripts in a scripts directory
- Reduce cross-cutting coupling with Events
- Code flow is followable - magic directories in the filesystem. The app starts at **app/server.js** and you can see everything it loads and executes by following the code.
    + Don't do magic things
    + Don't autoload files from
    + Don't do silly metaprogramming
- Be easy to locate code
    + Name are meaningful and accurate
    + Crufty code is fully removed, not left around in a orphan file or just
      commented out
- Use simple and obvious naming
- Use lower-kebab-case filenames
    + Npm forbids uppercase in new package names.
    + This format avoids filesystem case sensitivity issues across platforms
- Variable name must be camelCase
